# Contributing Guidelines

## Create an Issue First

* Always create an Issue before submitting a Pull Request (PR).
* Submit a PR only after the Issue has been approved.
* The project maintainer understands Japanese, but for searchability and accessibility to other contributors, write Issues in English.

## Branch Workflow

* Except for hotfix tasks, create a new branch from the develop branch.
* When your work is complete, open a PR targeting the develop branch.

## Coding Standards

* Follow the style and conventions of the existing codebase.
* When in doubt, align with the most recent code in the `develop` branch.
* Keep code clean, readable, and consistent.
* Write commit messages using only US-ASCII characters to avoid encoding issues.

## Development Environment

No specific development environment is required beyond what is described in the README.  
There are no strict Ruby version constraints, required libraries, or automated tests.

When contributing, please ensure your code runs as expected in a general Ruby environment and does not introduce unnecessary version restrictions.
